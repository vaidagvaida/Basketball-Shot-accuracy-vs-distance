    "As a Lithuanian,and a basketball fan since I was 7, I have decided to look at the NBA data. I Will be using 2 datasets for my analysis. I have selected the first dataset from www.Kaggle.com, which contains data of all the playes who took a shot during the 2014 - 2015 season.  Data also contains where was the shot taken from,shot result (Made it or failed it), the nearest defender, distance from defender, time on the shot clock and a few more. I have created the second data set by scraping the data from www.basketball-reference.com. I have used a python module called beautifulsoup (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4) in order to scrape the data. The second dataset contains the average game statistics for each basketball player during 2014 - 2015 season. I have joined the dataset by the Name of the player. With this data I will try to identify what factors influence players' success in making a shot. \n",

    "## Part-2: Analysis Strategy and Plans (maximum 200 words):\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will try to investigate what factors influence whether the player makes the shot or not. For example whether playing home helps players be more accurate than playing away, if players tend to score better at the end of the middle of score timer or at the very end. By joining two datasets together I will get the average statistics for each player per game (as well as other information (e.g the team they play for and possition they play)) as well as each shot they have made during 2014 - 2015 season. I will try to apply regression analysis as well as other methods that I might learn later in this year. \n",

    "\n",
    "I have looked at both datasets and found out that there have been a few misspellings in the dataset, I have taken from Kaggle. I have since updated these by creating a function that alters names to match the scraped dataset. Another problem that I have encountered is that some players have played for more than one team during this season - therefore ,  when merging data, the team players play for is likely to be incorrect, I will need to find out the time of the game (which is indicated in the 'matchup'column, which I will have to split in order to get the time game has occured) and cross-reference with instances mentioned in the scraped dataset. Also, not every shot has a shot clock value, therefore I will need to apply missing value treatment. I will need to decide weather I need to ignore these cases and remove them from the dataset or use mean/median shot clock value for each type of point (perhaps look at this by player: e.g replace Jonas Valanciunas' 2 point missing shot clock values with Jonas Valanciunas' median 2 point shot clock value). \n",
